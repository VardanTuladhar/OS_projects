Alright the do list for this project: 
-when newqueue is commited change states to ready and delete the processes from the vector 
-operating system simulator
	 if runningqueue = 0:  
		-schedule the ready queue based on the user selesction
		-send the first value into the ready queue and update PCB
	else:
		if operation size is >  0:
			if current op is calc:
				-decerement that operation cycle value
				if runing cycles = 0:
					-remove from the operations vector
	
			else:
				-move to the waiting state
		else:
			-go to the termination state
	if waitingqueue > 0:
		-itterate through all of the waitingqueue
		if their op is I/O:
			-decrement that operation cycle value
			if cycle value is 0:
				-remove from the operation queue
		else: 
			-move to the ready queue and update pcb
	-decrement loop
